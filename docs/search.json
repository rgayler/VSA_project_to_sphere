    "text": "At the Midnight Sun VSA Workshop 2023, Ross Gayler mentioned the thought experiment of projecting a Vector Symbolic Architecture hyperspace onto a sphere and observing the effects of the VSA operators on the hypervectors (video, slides). This involved much hand-waving, but no actual visualisations. The aim of this website is to computationally realise that thought experiment. We hope that this will help people to get a better intuitive understanding of Vector Symbolic Architectures."
