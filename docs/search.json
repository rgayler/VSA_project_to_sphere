    "text": "Motivation\nAt the Midnight Sun VSA Workshop 2023, Ross Gayler mentioned the thought experiment of projecting a Vector Symbolic Architecture hyperspace onto a sphere and observing the effects of the VSA operators on the hypervectors (video, slides). This involved much hand-waving, but no actual visualisations. The aim of this website is to computationally realise that thought experiment. We hope that this will help people to get a better intuitive understanding of Vector Symbolic Architectures.\n\n\nDesign\nThe principal objective is to project vectors of interest from a hyperdimensional space to a visualisable, low dimensional space in a way that (approximately) preserves the angles between the vectors of interest.\nThe angles between vectors are independent of the magnitudes of the vectors (except in the degenerate case of zero magnitude, in which case the angle is undefined). In VSA the hypervectors are often normalised to a constant magnitude. In this case the hypervectors all lie on the surface of a hypersphere.\nIf the hpervectors lie on a hypersphere it is convenient to project them to the surface of a sphere. This is easy to visualise and preserves the equal magnitudes of the vectors.\nThe elements of the hypervectors are complex numbers. This is the most general form of VSA currently in common use. The other common forms (real or binary valued elements) can be interpreted as special cases of the complex valued form. We project from the complex hypersphere to the real sphere because we are only interested in the angles between the vectors. It doesnâ€™t matter that the visualisation space is real valued.\nThe VSA operators are binary (sum, product), unary (negation, reciprocal), and nullary (0, 1) if you want to think of the constants as operators. Thus, there are at most three hypervectors linked by a single operator - two operands and the result. This is convenient because we can visualise a maximum of three mutually orthogonal vector on the surface of a sphere.\nIf it turns out that we need to represent more mutually orthogonal vectors we can reduce the arity of the binary operators by fixing one of the operands to a literal hypervector value (partial application).\nWe also want consider the angular relations to other (arbitrarily many) hypervectors not involved in the operation. Then we visualise the action of the unary partial function rather than the binary operator.\n\n\nAngles in VSA space\n\n\nQuasiorthogonality\n\n\nNegation\n\n\nInverse\n\n\nPermutation\n\n\nAddition (bundling)\n\n\nMultiplication (binding)"
