# Motivation

At the [Midnight Sun VSA Workshop 2023](https://sites.google.com/ltu.se/midnightvsa/home?authuser=0), [Ross Gayler](https://www.rossgayler.com/) mentioned the thought experiment of projecting a [Vector Symbolic Architecture](https://www.hd-computing.com/) hyperspace onto a sphere and observing the effects of the VSA operators on the hypervectors ([video](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8076677), [slides](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8076707)).
This involved much handwaving, but no actual visualisations.
The aim of this website is to computationally realise that thought experiment.
We hope that this will help people to get a better intuitive understanding of Vector Symbolic Architectures.
